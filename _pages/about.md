<span style="color: black;">Hi! I'm a senior at the University of Oregon studying business, computer science and economics. I'm looking for roles in computer programming (with a particular passion for work in machine learning systems), as well as analytical roles in the business and economics space. Computer Science takes up space in both my professional and personal life - it is something I truly enjoy. I like to read papers regarding new developments in computing, create side projects for things i'm interested in, and teach / help others on their own journey in comp sci.</span>

<span style="color: black;">I also love and enjoy almost all sports, fashion, home design, art, and spending time with my friends and family. I am a die-hard LeBron fan and follow basketball - mens and womens, college and professional - religiously. I also love almost all kinds of music, with some favorite genres including indie, rap, and pop.</span>

<span style="color: black;">- Kate Bush</span>
<span style="color: black;">- Greta Van Fleet</span>
