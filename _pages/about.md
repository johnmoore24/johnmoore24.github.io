<span style="color: black;">Hi! I'm a senior at the University of Oregon studying business, computer science and economics. I'm looking for roles in computer programming (with a particular passion for work in machine learning systems), as well as analytical roles in finance or risk management. Computer Science takes up space in both my professional and personal life - it is something I truly enjoy. I like to read papers regarding new developments in AI and create side projects for things i'm interested in. </span>

<span style="color: black;">I also love and enjoy almost all sports, fashion, home design, art, and spending time with my friends and family. I am a die-hard LeBron fan and follow basketball - mens and womens, college and professional - religiously. </span>
